py2scad installation instructions
=================================

Requirements:

  * scipy (not really sure which versions will work - a reasonbly recent one should do)
  * OpenSCAD (only required to view your parts, translate them the stl files, etc.)

Installation:

The package uses the Python setuptools, you can build it by calling

python setup.py install

which installs the package on your system.  See the "Installing Python
Modules" manual inside your Python documentation or at
